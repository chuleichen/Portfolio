        <p>This is a group project of the course SI582, Interaction Design. We are a group of five, who are Lizbeth Guerrero, Bonnie Jiang, Shirley Wang, Kylie Williams, and me.</p>
        <p>In this project, we go through the procedure of an app design together, including problem statement, competitive analysis, user interviews, personas and scenarios design, sketches and story boards, paper prototype, user flow design, wireframes, digital prototype, and user testing on both our paper prototypes and digital prototypes.</p>
        <p>I will go through the main procedures and furture impact in the following parts. </p>
        <p>Here is a <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/2Lz1Yrg4bo7Mh5YH16Lxox/SI582-Final?node-id=1%253A55&scaling=scale-down">link</a> to our final digital prototype. You can play with it!</p>
        <p>And below is a demostration video of our final digital prototype.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement & Competitive Analysis & User Interviews</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="center text">
        <p>The requirements from the course is that we need to find an interactive design problem that is related to the pandemic, and the target users are not limited to college students. After a brainstorming in the group, we found that during the pandemic, several group members mentioned that it was really hard to have a variety of food. So, we decided to build an app that can help people to exchange food in their neighborhood, and can strengthen the communication in the community. </p>
        <p>In the competitive analysis, we chose 5 companies as our competitors. NextDoor is a parallel competitor, since it is a community-based website and can help people to share some information in their neighborhood. WeChat is an analogous competitor, though it does not have a direct function to help people share their food and daily necessities, it is aiming at creating instant communication between individuals. The remaining three are partial competitors, which are Freshly, Instacart, and Hungry Harvest. All of them provide services like delivering groceries.</p>
        <p>After doing the user interviews, we further found out that people are having difficulties not only with finding more kinds of food, but also with buying some daily necessities or finding some people with works like gardening, so we decided to make the coverage of our product  larger. And users mentioned the security problem with such kinds of apps. We thought about only allowing users to exchange food like bakeries in our apps, because this is the only food that can be sold without a license. But after discussing the issues with our instructor team, since it is a course work, we decided to ignore the problem for now.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Personas & Scenerios</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="center text">
        <p>We built four personas for our projects, where Rosa, the single mother is our main persona. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="left pic">

          <figcaption>Persona 4</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="center text">
        <p>We used our personal interviews to gather some information on potential users to define specific personas. At first we had difficulties combining personas, setting personas to include more target users, and lacked some basic user information. According to different interviewees, our group first separated our persona into five categories: student, parent, young working adult, middle age adult and senior. We listed different characteristics of each persona, that is, the financial background, the living situation, transportation, experience of exchanging with others and willing to join the community. After combining the characteristics of our interviewees into 4 personas, we were able to expand our user group to find different concerns to design. Creating personas is a good way to understand the needs, concerns and experiences of a specific group of users.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Sketches & Storyboards</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="center text">
        <p>In these parts, firstly, all of the group members did some sketches individually. We tried to imagine what our product can do and under what circumstances can it be used. Here are my sketches.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left pic">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="center text">
        <p>After finishing our individual sketches, we tried to combine our sketches into two storyboards to tell two complete stories about how our product can be used under different circumstances.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left pic">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="center text">
        <p>This was fun work for me. It was like doing a brainstorm and trying to give more possibilities to our product. After doing the work, we had a clearer image about what our product should be about and what kind of aspects we should pay attention to.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="left text">
        <p>This part is an individual work. </p>
        <p>Literally, a paper prototype should be made in paper. The beneficial points of it are that it can be done in a short time and is not money-consuming. However, in order to do the usability test on the paper prototype I made more conveniently, I drew the screens on an iPad and used different layers to show different screens. </p>
        <p>After doing a simple usability test on it and sharing our ideas in the group, we began to make our user-flow diagram.</p>
        <p>Here is a video of my demonstration of the paper prototype. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <video src="files/paper_prototype_chuleich.mp4"></video>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>User-Flow Diagram</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div  class="center text">
        <p>This is actually the part we had the most discussion in the whole project. We changed the structure of the app multiple times. Although the structure kept changing in the following steps, this was the first time we thought about the complete structure of an app together. </p>
        <p>Below are two of our drafts and our final version.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="multi-pic">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="center text">
        <p>In this step, we talked mostly about the filters in the searching page. At first, we wanted to include features like price, distance, transportation mode, and so on. Then, we decided to add more, like item categories, users’ ranking scores, and whether the posts are by a friend of the user. However, then we found that the filter will be too complicated. Even ourselves could not remember all the features. So, we only keep price and distance at last. </p>
        <p>Also, this is the first time we considered the navigation bar. What tabs should we have? And which pages or functions should be put under a certain tab. We also used other apps about shopping as our references.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="left pic">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="right text">
        <p>Though not interactable and do not have any real contents, the wireframes are already like an app. We had a long discussion about where to put the navigation bar, and decided to put “home”, “exchange”, “search”, and “me” at the bottom of the page and to put “message” and “make a post” at the top. </p>
        <p>After deciding the overall structure of the pages, we divided the work. The part I have done in this step is to make the icons library, and make the search page and the post details page, which are shown below.</p>

    <h2>Early Versions of the Digital Prototype</h2>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="right text">
        <p>Finally, we came to digital prototyping. But before that, we chose the tools we would like to use and set the style guide. We tested four different tools, Figma, Adobe XD, Sketches, and Framer. We analyzed the pros and cons of each tool, and decided to use Figma because it supports cooperation best. </p>
        <p>However, the style guide in the first version is a little bit rough. We only tested different fonts and made a color palette.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="center pic">
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Different Styles of the same Page</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="center text">
        <p>Besides the potential problems, the first version of our digital prototype was already interactable. In this version, the most significant changes were that we added “exchange history”, “thank you notes”, and “settings” pages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left pic">
        <figure>
          <img src="images/app-16.png" alt="1st prototype - design">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="left text">
        <p>The second version of the digital prototype was similar to the previous version, but with more interactive features. For example, we add “view more comments” to the “post details page”. Also, we changed the “exchange” tab in the navigation bar to “my posts”, since we thought that the word “exchange” may not be clear enough for new users.</p>
        <p>Then, we did a usability test on the digital prototype.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right pic">
        <figure>
          <img src="images/app-18.png" alt="post details page">

    <h2> Final Digital Prototype</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="left text">
        <p>Before making the final digital prototype, we searched for ios’s official style guide, and made a final version of the style guide, including font size, colors, button size, and so on. Also, we found some slight displacement in our navigation bar, so we made it again to ensure that the position of them on each page is the same.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right pic">
        <figure>
          <img src="images/app-20.png" alt="style guide">

          <figcaption>Header and Navigation Bar</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="right text">
        <p>According to the usability test, most users were confused about the “my posts” tab in the navigation bar, so we did a re-design of it. We moved all the history and on-going posts into the “profile” tab, and adjusted the “plus” button to make it clear on every page and make the user flow more efficient.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="left text">
        <p>In order to keep in consistency with the style, we changed the filters in the search page to make it similar to the ones in “make a post” page. Also, considering the pandemic situation, we added “mask required” as a tag in the filters.</p>
        <p>And with other minor modifications, like the icons on the homepage and the structure of the settings page, we finally completed the final digital prototype.</p>

    <h2>Impact - Positive</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">

          <figcaption>Reviews, Thank You Notes, and Edit Post Pages</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <div class="right text">
        <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <p>Reviews are used to build trust within the neighborhood network and to help ensure the sources are reliable. Shared Pantry allows users to provide feedback not only about specific items, but also regarding their experience connecting with users. </p>
        <h3>Thank You Notes</h3>
        <p>We designed a Give Thanks function to create a community and build lasting connections. Shared Pantry could encourage communication and help individuals who feel isolated, especially during Covid-19.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="center text">
        <h3>Allergens & Mask Required:</h3>
        <p>For the health and safety of our users, we implemented an allergen selection, as well as a checkbox function to specify mask requirements for meeting in-person. Shared Pantry offers an alternative means of acquiring essential items and could alleviate fears and reservations present in the grocery shopping experience.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Impact - Negative</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="center text">
        <h3>Dislike Button</h3>
        <p> Although the initial idea behind the dislike button was to make sellers aware that their posts are unpopular, we later realized that including a dislike button could dissuade users from submitting posts if they have had dislikes in a prior experience. This could also lead users to express discontent with a post or a user.</p>
        <h3>Food Safety</h3>
        <p>Users are largely on their own in confirming that a seller has positive reviews and in trusting that their food is edible and following food safety standards. Without proper verification that food safety standards are followed, there is chance for potential food poisoning to occur. </p>
        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>Given that our app requires interacting with strangers, there is a level of risk each user poses at the point of exchange. Additionally, there is a risk for users to steer away from conversing about exchanges without platform moderators.</p>
        <h3>Missing Guidelines</h3>
        <p>To encourage everyone to use safety practices and be respectful of each other, we should have been explicit about community engagement guidelines and an option to report cases where food safety protocols were not followed. Not including these could lead to abuse in our platform.</p>
      </div>
